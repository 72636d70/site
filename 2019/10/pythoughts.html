        <h3>pythoughts</h3>
            <p>I've been learning python for the last few days, using Zed A. Shaw's book, "Learn Python The Hard Way". I'm enjoying it quite a lot. I'm halfway through the book (ex.28/52) and I'd like to share my goals and thoughts on the matter.</p>
            <p class="it">Goals, and how to achieve them</p>
                <p>Goal the first: <u>learn python</u>. That might seem ambiguous or very general, so let me contextualize. By saying <i>"learn python"</i>, I mean I want to understand python to the point of being able to write programs with no or very little documentation references.</p>
                <p>I plan to achieve this goal by learning all I can in two to three hours every day. When I feel that I know a concept well enough, I will make a small pointless program to showcase the concepts learned. I've already made a simple <a href="/code/guessthenumber.txt">guess the number</a> game that showcases a lot of simple concepts, such as storing variables, importing methods, creating functions, taking input from the user, and printing to the screen.</p>
                <p>Goal the second: <u>get a job</u>. Also a very ambiguous goal. To rephrase: get a Jr position in a company that will allow me to work remotely with limited (depending on company location) travel. A remote position is critical as it will allow me to spend more time with my children.</p>
                <p>How to achieve this? See goal #1. Hard work, dedication to learning, and willingness to take a lesser salary in exchange for a better work environment.</p>
            <p class="it">Thoughts</p>
                <p>My thoughts on the subject? I haven't been doing it long enough to reccommend any particular language. I chose python because I've had some prior experience with it (about 5 years ago) and from what I can tell it's a fairly versatile language. I've heard that once you know the core language you can easily transfer to a more powerful language such as C.  This may or may not be a choice for me. I'll have to re-evaluate in six months to a year.</p>
                <p>In closing? I don't know. I'm enjoying this. I've got goals and a decent plan to achieve them. We'll see what happens in a year. Always dig deeper, friends.</p>
